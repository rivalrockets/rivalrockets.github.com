If you&#8217;re pressed for time, this a good way to make a decent profit, and it has a little bit of variety too.

_**Isle of Quel&#8217;Danas**_

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Air Strikes Must Continue</strong></span> &#8211; very simple&#8230; just go along for the ride. Make sure you put the bomb in a hot key, targeting the units is tricky, and you don&#8217;t want to do this out of your backpack or even a sidebar. If you dont&#8217; get all the guys on the first run, no big deal, you can go again, the enemy totals don&#8217;t reset after each run

2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Erratic Behavior/Further Conversions</strong></span> &#8211; Pick this quest over the other one in the area&#8230; the sentries are yellow until attacked, and are much easier to take down. Go around the north shore, staying on the beach&#8230; otherwise you will aggro the undead guys. Once you kill an erratic sentry, loot it before using the crystal on it&#8230; they drop motes of mana, and you can&#8217;t loot after you&#8217;ve transformed it with the crystal.

3. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Know Your Ley Lines</span>** - The key here is not aggroing mobs going in&#8230; this usually isn&#8217;t too hard as there are plenty of horde/alliance players doing this for you already! You must go to three separate locations in all.

After these three quests, use your scroll you received as a reward to port back to Shattrath.

**_Throne of Kil&#8217;jaeden (northern Hellfire)_**

4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blast the Gateway</strong></span> &#8211; A great help here is that you can charge your living flare by helping kill other elementals, even ones horde have aggroed! It takes about 8-10 elementals to charge it up, so this defintely helps. You also get a nice pack of shattered sun supplies, which has a green or better item inside.

5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blood for Blood</strong></span> &#8211; Kill the demons, until you have 4 units of blood, Then pull one of the elites and use a single siphon charge on it&#8230; it takes a moment, but they will turn in into emaciated fel bloods, and you can kill them with ease. Respawn here is very quick, so make sure you are fighting in a corner. When you turn in, you can choose between Aldor or Scryer marks (5), which is a nice bonus.

6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kazzak Must be Tickled</strong></span> &#8211; not a very well known quest, but very easy to do, especially since you&#8217;re already in the area. Just walk up to Kazzak, type /tickle, and he&#8217;ll fall over laughing. A few wacks with your weapon of choice, and you&#8217;re done&#8230; Seriously&#8230;
