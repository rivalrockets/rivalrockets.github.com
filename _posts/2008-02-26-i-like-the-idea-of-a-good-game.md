...Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, VIII, IX, XII, Halo CE, Starcraft, Half-Life 1 and 2, HL2 Ep. 1 & 2, Supreme Commander, Crysis...

... keep this list in mind as you read.

I've come to notice a very prominent trend in my gaming repertoire: I like good video games.  In the last decade I have purchased over 100 games for various platforms (ranging from my trusty PSX to my beloved PC), and yet, I can count the number of games that I've 'passed' on one hand!

It comes down to this: **I like the _idea_ of a good game.** It's really quite simple: I'm not necessarily buying these titles for their stories (although stories are certainly a strong selling point) I seem to be more interested in a game's execution.  I enjoy looking at how a game works&#8211;not in how it ends.  Sadly, before I've even begun to dig into the subtleties and nuances of a beloved new game, the lure and charms of a newly released "distraction" overcome me.

The list I started at the beginning of this article contains a _small_ subset of the many titles I have purchased and have yet to complete.

So I ask: What does it take to be the kind of gamer that completes what he (or she) begins?  Is it a higher level of commitment that I lack?  Is it an absence of passion for the pastime?

On that note I declare that soon I will select a title that I intend to beat before the year is out.  From that, perhaps, I can take what I've learned and apply it to my daily life.
