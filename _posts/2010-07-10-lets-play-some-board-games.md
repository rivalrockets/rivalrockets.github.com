I’m entering a period where I am getting tired of playing PC games.&#160;&#160; This last happened for me about 2004, and didn’t recover until mid 2007.&#160;&#160; Since I’ve stopped playing World of Warcraft in March, I’ve been experimenting with various games.&#160;&#160; I’ve played Borderlands, GTA IV, Left 4 Dead 1/2, Dead Space, Garry’s Mod, Dragon Age, and Portal.&#160;&#160; They are mostly fun games, to be sure, but I haven’t been having _that_ much fun.&#160;&#160; One of the reasons I stopped gaming in 2004 was because the games then didn’t seem to have something new to offer.&#160;&#160; Yes the graphics were better, but was UT 2003 more enjoyable than the original? Not really.&#160;&#160; 

At present I am starting to notice this happen again with the current crop of titles, and there have been some issues that, well, just _piss me off_.&#160;&#160; $59 dollars for a new game?&#160;&#160; Come on.&#160;&#160; Flaky DRM schemes and installation limits?&#160; Fine, treat me like a criminal.&#160;&#160; Piss-poor ports of console games at full price and months late?&#160;&#160; Oh, you must think I have no _choice_ in the matter…&#160;&#160; That being said, I’m not abandoning PC gaming or anything.&#160;&#160; It’s just that for me, the benefits bar is slipping, and the hassle bar is rising quickly.&#160;&#160; 

As this post title indicates, I think that board games might help fill the gap in PC gaming.&#160;&#160; I want to play something that is engaging, fun, and has complexity.&#160;&#160; It should be social, and if I play badly I want to daydream about how I will do better next time…&#160;&#160; There is a lot to like about a good board game:

  * It only takes a few minutes to set up
  * It is easily portable
  * Most are designed to be completed in 1-3 hours
  * Most have an easy learning curve

They aren’t perfect though.&#160;&#160; Two player board games usually aren’t that fun, and some times you have too many people or an odd number of people.&#160;&#160; Still, they can be simpler affairs than LAN’s, and just as much fun.&#160;&#160; 

So here’s what I’m thinking.&#160;&#160; Sometime in the next few months, I would like to host a board game night at my house.&#160;&#160;&#160; The basic format would be dinner, the game, and optionally a movie (or another round or game).&#160;&#160; I’m looking for a minimum of three players, with a max of six.&#160;&#160; Google bots are not invited, even if they have been faithful readers of this blog.&#160;&#160; 

As for the game, I’ve listed three possibilities below.&#160;&#160; I do not own any of these, but would purchase the one to be played, unless it could be provided by someone else.&#160;&#160; I will take suggestions for other games as well, but if you suggest scrabble you are not grasping my point  <img src='http://localhost/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />&#160;&#160; 

## Axis & Allies

I played this a number of times in college, and it never failed to please.&#160; I think I’ve played the three main variations, including Europe and Pacific theatres.&#160;&#160; 

## The Settlers of Catan

I’ve never played this game, but it looks intriguing.&#160;&#160; Looking at the wikipedia page, it sounds a lot like Civilization for PC, which I love, but incidentally hate because it can take ten hours to finish a game!

## Heroscape

I haven’t played this game either.&#160; I really like the idea of an RPG/D&D style board game.&#160;&#160; I played one as a teenager called [Hero Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_Quest) but it is out of print, and full versions now go for over a hundred bucks!&#160;&#160; One thing that might not be so great about it is that there seems to be a lot of “add-ons” for this game, which screams money pit.&#160;&#160; I did see that you can buy a “master set” for under $40, and if this could provide several evenings of entertainment it may be worth it.&#160;&#160;
