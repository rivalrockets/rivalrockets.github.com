Call it a mild obsession if you will, but I think LED&#8217;s are quite wicked-cool.&#160; For example, posted above is our new <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/7437/" target="_blank">TIX clock</a> which we picked up from ThinkGeek.com.&#160; No, it&#8217;s not binary, but it&#8217;s not the most simple of things to read either&#8230; the lights randomly shift their orientation, so it can be quite a challenge.&#160; It has been fun to use to tell time and my wife and I have been inclined to use it even though there are far quicker clocks to read at hand.&#160; Another perk: it&#8217;s bright as heck! making for a nice nightlight.
