Call it a mild obsession if you will, but I think LED's are quite wicked-cool.  For example, posted above is our new [TIX clock](http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/7437/) which we picked up from ThinkGeek.com.  No, it's not binary, but it's not the most simple of things to read either... the lights randomly shift their orientation, so it can be quite a challenge.  It has been fun to use to tell time and my wife and I have been inclined to use it even though there are far quicker clocks to read at hand.  Another perk: it's bright as heck! making for a nice nightlight.
