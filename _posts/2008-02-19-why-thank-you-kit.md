Kit, the chief administrator of Rival Rockets Ltd. has graciously given I, Head of Gladiatorial Affairs Sean a joint share in his weblog! Special thanks to the chief administrator for giving me such opportunities! Together, we shall increase the power and prestige of our sponsored counterpart, the autonomous World of Warcraft guild: Piracy Incorporated!

Long live Piracy!
