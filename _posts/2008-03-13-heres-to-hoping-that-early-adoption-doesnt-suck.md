I won't call it an impulse buy, but it certainly wasn't a completely cautious purchase—that's for sure. Today I ordered the absolutely brand-new (just flagged as in stock <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-000594-diNovo-Mini/dp/B0011FOOI2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1205465167&sr=8-1" target="_blank">yesterday</a>)  <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard/devices/3848&cl=us,en" target="_blank">DiNovo Mini.</a>

  It's for my media PC in the hopes of replacing my gargantuan Bluetooth Microsoft Multimedia Keyboard. This should be the best thing that's happened to my HTPC since--well since it got a microATX form factor.

  The diNovo Mini sports a thumb typing style with back-lit keys and a flip open cover to cover it up when it's not in use. I have no guarantee that it'll play nice with Airwalker (a Linux-blooded machine).  But here's to hope!
