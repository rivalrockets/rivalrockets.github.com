My Black Warhorse Rainsford is taking a long-needed break.  He currently resides in my bank vault at Stormwind.  In his place as my alternate ground mount, I have adopted a mighty war-elephant named Jumbo.  Where the fierce, yet gentle-natured Jumbo treads, the earth trembles and the waters quake.  The very skies broadcast his powerful reverberating footfalls for many miles out of pure respect.

Also, Rutherford, my Dragonhawk recently hit 70.  With one last slot to fill with a protege, I went to obtain a creature that had JUST become tamable: A certain Druid I know.
