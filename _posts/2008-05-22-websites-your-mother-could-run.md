I&#8217;ve been considering stepping up to answer a request that my church has put out asking for help revamping/rejuvenating their [website](http://www.bethluthspencer.com). I&#8217;d normally never consider myself any kind of option when it comes to web design, but given my relative success with this site&#8230; let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m considering it.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bethluth.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-124 aligncenter" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bethluth-180x180.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>
</p>

The first problem with the church&#8217;s current site as it stands is that **there is no one in charge of site maintenance/management**. As best as I can tell, the site&#8217;s creation date is sometime in the year 2000 and has seen minimal alteration since then. It&#8217;s a static html website with exactly one picture and a &#8220;Microsoft Frontpage&#8221; banner in the corner&#8230; [shudder].

Upon further investigation, however, I was able to discern that the server that hosts this, shall we say, _elderly_ page is not some dusty old Win9x box sitting in the cellar of the church, but rather, an up-to-date Apache server! And perhaps more importantly, it has _PHP_ installed:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bethluth404.png" alt="" />

Now we&#8217;re talking my language! But WordPress, while it makes [a great blog site](http://rivalrockets.com/blog/), doesn&#8217;t exactly sound like it&#8217;ll fit the needs of a church.

A friend of mine just recently mentioned [Joomla](http://joomla.org/), as a great choice for website content management. I&#8217;ve done a test install and my initial reactions are very positive. It seems Joomla has the &#8220;front page&#8221; feature that is absent from WordPress (by design, mind you). Also, don&#8217;t confuse my term &#8220;front page&#8221; with the disabling enabling software from Microsoft&#8230;

The &#8220;killer feature&#8221; of Joomla as a content management system (CMS) for the church is the fact that once the page is in place, the page content can be managed my someone _else_&#8216;someone whose _job_ is to update resources meant for broadcasting current events and announcements.

With the encouraging results from dabbling in the Joomla software, I envision a new site that is easy for the church staff, volunteers and possibly even the pastors to use to communicate with current and future church members.

I&#8217;ll post back here any further developments (if there _are_ any) on this thread of an idea.
