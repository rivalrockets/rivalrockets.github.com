Having over 24,000 followers on twitter at the time of this writing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Savage" target="_blank">Adam Savage</a> (of MythBusters fame) is no stranger to the venerable &#8220;@&#8221; tweet.  Having been directed (by <a href="http://twitter.com/donttrythis" target="_blank">his Twitter feed</a>) to <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/adam_savage_s_obsessions.html" target="_blank">his outstanding TED talk</a>, I became immediately curious as to how he managed his &#8220;Creative Projects&#8221; repository of images, having recently begun the task of organizing the thousands of images my wife and I have taken with our family camera over the years, I felt certain that Mr. Savage had a better handle on the intricacies of managing large volumes of digital photos.

Having searched the various <a href="http://lifehacker.com/372605/best-digital-photo-organizer" target="_blank">lifehacker</a>-esqe blogs and self-help sites, I was unable to find the ultimate mass photo manager.  Google&#8217;s <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa 3</a> is promising but a little clunky (and lacks native Flickr support), <a href="http://f-spot.org/" target="_blank">F-Spot</a> looks quite nice, but alas is Linux-only (thus alienating my photo collection), and Adobe Organizer which costs money (came with my copy of Photoshop Elements 6) future support and upgrades are a joke here&#8230;

Here&#8217;s where Adam Savage comes in.  Although my luck in the past has been more hit than miss with using the &#8220;@&#8221; message on Twitter, the prospect of getting to the bottom of this mystery was enough for me to give it a try by asking the man himself:

[<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" src="/content/2009/04/image1.png" border="0" alt="" width="561" height="169" />](http://twitter.com/kitroed/status/1476501801)

and much to my surprise, the humble Adam Savage did me the honor of not only answering my question, but explaining his selection as well:

[<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" src="/content/2009/04/donttrythis-reply1.png" border="0" alt="donttrythis_reply" width="620" height="342" />](http://twitter.com/donttrythis/status/1476935105)

Without going into the details of how Twitter has changed how I view the availability of otherwise unreachable people&#8230;

Mr. Savage, thank you for making my day.
