World of Warcraft meets casual gaming couple. More after the break.

With the help of friend Kevinsorbo, I took Eilonwy to the Outland&#8230; yes, she&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; level 56 so that makes questing there not a real possibility, but I did get to take her to Shatt, so that was fun. Before we went there we gazed at the other side of the portal that she cannot go through:

Welcome to Outland, Love.
