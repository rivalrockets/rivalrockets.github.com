Seriously, HDTV's and the powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28seventh_generation%29" target="_blank">7th-generation era</a> consoles have the wonderful PC gaming experience under a serious threat of being ... exterminated, or at the very least, reduced to a shell of its former self.

I know I echo the declarations of countless other writers with statements such as these. A couple of points that used to distinguish the PC platform from it's entertainment center-bound cousin become less and less defined as TV sets get bigger and clearer, and networks get faster and more accessible. This all reinforced by the news that some developers' <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/682890/Epic_to_Focus_on_Consoles_Not_PC.html" target="_blank">recent actions seem to agree</a>.

Many of you know the arguments for the inevitable _coup d'etat_ that awaits PC gamers everywhere—be it the ease of setting up a new game, or the assured _ubiquity_ of these platforms—it seems there are many reasons for PC gamers to fret. However, I propose that surely there are profound reasons to believe that the PC gaming market is not doomed. I've heard it said that MMO's will never be transferable to a console... is that so? Even RTS games are beginning to <a href="http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1519/Command-Conquer-3-Tiberium-Wars/" target="_blank">pop up on consoles</a>.

So I ask: **what sells the PC gaming world?** Is it freedom from hyper-commercialization that the consoles suffer from? Is it the glorious mouse-keyboard control scheme that can't _quite_ be replicated by a controller, or is it the PC itself: a virtually organic, constantly changing, evolving _companion_—open and not bound to one <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">corporate interest</a> that will be the ultimate salvation?

Or is it the fact that I derive some sort of sick pleasure from torturing myself with what I estimate to be at least _300_ hours a year spent "troubleshooting" my beloved (read: _f\*cking peice of sh\*t_) computer?  :)
