I was inspired by Brian's doling of law enforcement in the Stormwind Stockade to do my own dealings with Van Cleef and his sad excuses for pirates in the Deadmines.  Piracy Incorporated takes all the benefits of smuggling, gun-running, pillaging and Black-market dealings and filters them into the sparkling facade of International Corporate Deals. We run piracy as a business, and when business is bad, we send a specialist to "work out" the problem. Recently, we cut a deal with the Defias organization by supplying them with weapons and other equipment.   I don't know if the memo got around or not, but Edwin Van Cleef refused to pay the fees, and killed the delivery-men (they were level 2 peasants).  "Don't Worry, we sent a specialist," said our anonymous dispatcher.  I and Shagohad raged through the mines killing all in our path, taking out the mines, the goblin forge, and the the ship in record time.  Van Cleef and his assistants were dropped in 4 seconds flat.  It just goes to show, you don't screw around with Piracy Incorporated. Afterward, I paid a visit to some local Murlocs that violated certain trade agreements they had with us.
