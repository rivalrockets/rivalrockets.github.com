Thanks to a handy tip:

<http://maintankadin.failsafedesign.com/viewtopic.php?t=18093>

I was able to learn how to Solo Onyxia!!  While this fearesome <sic> creature used to require 30-40 60&#8242;s to take down, she can now be bested by only a few number of courageous <sic> heroes.   The fight is actually not that difficult&#8230; it is just long as she has over a million hit points.   The big concern was phase 2, where she flies in the air and whelps come out.   I wiped on the first attempt, but I got the hang of it, and on 2nd try I got her down in about 30-45 min.  I&#8217;m not sure what other classes are capable of soloing, besides druid and maybe a lock.   I know people have done it at lvl 70, but those were crazy 3 hour attempts.

She had quite the treasure for me as well, netting 159g, several epics, and an 18 slot bag.    I prob won&#8217;t do this by myself again anytime soon, as 1 or two dps would speed things up greatly, and would still be making a good amount of gold.

Somebody&#8217;s mad!

She&#8217;s down
