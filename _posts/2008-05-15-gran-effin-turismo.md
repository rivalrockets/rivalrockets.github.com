<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-113" title="race_car" src="/content/2008/05/race_car-400x215.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="215" />The _one_ game that could make me cry about not having the gratuitously expensive PS3 is Gran Turismo 5

[Ars talks](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/games/gt5-prologue-review.ars) about the recently relased "demo" of GT5 titled _Gran Turismo 5: Prologue_

Racing games have not quite delivered for me yet, there's an experience that I'm looking for in my next foray into the genre: multiplayer support.

I personally believe that the greatest enjoyment I could receive from a classic series like Gran Turismo was beating some _human_ chap in a closely matched race.

My appeal sirs and madams is this: can this racing experience found on the console be replicated on my beloved PC?  Does it even exist?
