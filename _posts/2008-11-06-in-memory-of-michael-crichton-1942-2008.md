One of my all-time favorite authors, the science fiction genius Michael Crichton,  passed away November 4th, 2008 from Cancer.

He was probably best known for his book: Jurassic Park, and also as the creator of the television series: ER.

Crichton was, in my opinion, a science fiction genius.  He could take fantastic ideas like resurrecting dinosaurs, controlling the weather, and time travel, and make it seem believeable!  He embedded these concepts in so much real science, that one could not help but wonder why scientists weren&#8217;t ALREADY breeding raptors.

A great writer, a doctor, and an inspiration to people everywhere.

Here&#8217;s to you, Michael.  Rest in peace.
