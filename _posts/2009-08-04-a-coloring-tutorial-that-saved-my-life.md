Well, not really.  But "Basic Color Blending" by [Andantonius](http://andantonius.deviantart.com/) from Deviant Art, found [here](http://andantonius.deviantart.com/art/Andart-Basic-Blending-101327993), is one of the most insightful and helpful tutorials I've ever seen for digital coloring.

Credit goes to Kit for finding this amazing video first.  He showed it to me a while back, and I just now got to watching it since my web speed was increased.

Here's some before/after images showing my improvement after being enlightened by Andantonius.

_**Before:**_

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484" title="Before Tutorial" src="/content/2009/08/NGC-AfterLAN-in-progress-copy.jpg" alt="Before Tutorial" width="1020" height="1006" />

_**After:**_

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-491" title="Fauntleroy-Ranvier-Refsheet" src="/content/2009/08/Fauntleroy-Ranvier-Refsheet1.jpg" alt="Fauntleroy-Ranvier-Refsheet" />

If one looks closely, the color blending, highlights,  and shading are of considerably higher quality!

Thanks to Andantonius, my future work is sure to be something I can take pride in.
