It&#8217;s kinda slick, WP2.5 uses globally recognized avatars (gravatar) which encodes a unique identifier (in this case, your email) and pulls your avatar into any comments that are posted with your email address. It&#8217;s a way to sort of put a face to a name, or in the very least, a graphic to a name   <img src='http://localhost/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />. The gravatar homepage is at <a href="http://www.gravatar.com" target="_blank">gravatar.com</a>.
