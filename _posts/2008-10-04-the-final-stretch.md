It&#8217;s been a slow, and rather lame-ass march, but it at last seems like I&#8217;m closing the gap to that epic 5,000 gold in World of Warcraft that shall guarantee me the right to ride a flying mount capable of speeds in excess of 279% percent my normal running speed.  They are true SR-71&#8242;s of Outland, and after being badly beat to the finish line by Brian&#8217;s wife, Kim, I&#8217;m more anxious than ever to prove that I don&#8217;t totally suck at earning fake money.

Ironically, however, it seems that _real_ money is holding me back from my position as a flying ace.  My WoW account runs out on the 7th of October.  I&#8217;m still kicking my self for not having been able to save up the 5k over the summer, but pulling off a stunt like that would require me to live as a hermit in an Internet accessible cave high in the Andes Mountains above Chile.

I have a plan to reclaim my glory though.  I&#8217;m going to re-open my status as a commissioned artist with a few tweaks to make dealings more streamlined.

Firstly, I will no longer be doing fully-photoshopped pictures unless someone requests so and has the means to pay fifteen dollars to me.  I find myself excruciatingly slow in photoshop, especially when under pressure.

Secondly, The standard commission will cost eight dollars, and consist of a very _finished_ looking pencil drawing of either the client as a cartoon character, or something that they request.

On a lesser note, thirdly, these commissions are **NOT** caricatures.  They are drawings of people and/or things in a cartoon style of my own, not drastic accentuation of facial features.  I&#8217;m not a guy working at a mall kiosk.

Of course, I&#8217;m not asking anyone who reads this if they&#8217;d like to commission me.  You all already fall into my &#8220;Do things for free&#8221; list.  However, encouragement would be psychosomatically helpful. ^^
