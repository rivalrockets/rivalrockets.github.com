I&#8217;m writing this post to officially request a slot on the calender in the near future being cleared of all schedule.  Some weekend soon now, I would like to be a part of a Sins of a Solar Empire marathon held at the abode of Administrator Kit.  What I have planned is no mere all-nighter.  It is an all-dayer; starting around 10 or 11 in the morning and going until a game is finished.  There would be regular breaks for things like meals, bathroom usage, and eye-rest, as well as strategic planning on a marker board map of the system.  I want to _really_ get into this.  How difficult would a shindig like this be to set up?
