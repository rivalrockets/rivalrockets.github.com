I used to see guides that would indicate 10 days to 70, but I soon realized that was played time. I started playing on December 28, and leveled on April 11&#8230; Thats 106 days&#8230; or approx 4 hours of played time per day&#8230; I didn&#8217;t start out with the goal of leveling to 70 by a certain date, it just sort of happened. While it is nice to achieve this milestone, that is a whole heap of time. I can honestly say WOW is a game like no other I&#8217;ve played. It feels like I&#8217;ve played three games already, and there is much more yet to come. My expectations were much different three months ago then they are now. I thought I would take some time and share some of those thoughts&#8230;

**On being a Paladin&#8230;**

Loving it. I was pretty sure it was the class I wanted to play when I started, and I haven&#8217;t been disappointed. I did take some time at the start to do research on how to play the class, and that really helped a lot. The versatility of this class is awesome, and I&#8217;ve played all three roles with great success.

**On playing on a live server&#8230;**

Yes there are annoying people to be sure, but I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the social aspect of the game much more than I thought I would. Let me be clear however, that I still see no value in forging relationships past the game
  
**
  
On Professions&#8230;**

Blacksmithing is definitely underwhelming. Even though I&#8217;ve made well over 1500g as a sub 70, it wasn&#8217;t at all like I expected. I mean&#8230; rods&#8230; How boring is that? I haven&#8217;t sold a SINGLE piece of armor or a weapon for over 10G, and most of the time I don&#8217;t even bother. As for being a personal armorer, it&#8217;s been dissapointing as well. Most of the good recipies are drops, and are usually much $$ on AH. Then you get
  
into outrageous mat costs. I mean&#8230; who the heck wants to round up 20 arcanite bars for a pre60 item? Until I got to outland blacksmithing was a joke past level 40. Blizzard should have cut the mat cost for those items by 75% once BC came out.

**On PvP&#8230;**

Blizzard was definitely right when they said that it will be tough for a while, then get better. There was a time when I could have quit the game it was so frustrating. I found that instances really help with avoiding it too. And while I hate getting ganked, it&#8217;s fun to do it. That being said, I try to be reasonable when I do this. One kill is enough&#8230; there is no reason to camp unless some further agression as taken place.

**On paying a monthly fee&#8230;**

Yeah, I guess it&#8217;s worth it. There is so much going for this game, and with a high investment of time, I think it is good that Blizzard is vested in making the game as worthwhile as possible. However, I think something needs to be done with casuals. If you play only 5-10 hours a week, you should NOT have to pay the same fee as someone playing 50+ hours a week!! That doesn&#8217;t mean that blizzard has to charge an hourly rate, they could have a few simple tiers. Another big gripe is availability. If you are paying for a monthtly service, you should demand accountability and availability of your service! Would you put up with your cell phone not working or you cable going dead several times a week? Granted, this hasn&#8217;t been a problem yet, but I think we deserve a higher level of service. At the minimum, any downtime during the day should result in a free days credit of play&#8230; it&#8217;s only fair.

**On lack of storyline&#8230;**

I can&#8217;t believe that they couldn&#8217;t come up with in-game cut scenes like they did in warcraft III. I don&#8217;t understand any of the current lore because I am simply not interested in reading it online. Warcraft III had a great model (cheesy, but good), which would have added a lot to this game in my opinion.

On time to level&#8230;
  
** 
  
Too long. While I had a lot of fun getting here, I cringe at the thought of doing it with another character. I like playing through a game 3-4 times with different characters, and this is simply not realistic with WoW. I&#8217;ve gotten at least 2-4 Diablo II characters to the 40&#8242;s-60&#8242;s. It doesn&#8217;t help that the content can be very repetitive. The only purpose of a game it entertainment&#8230; is Wow more enjoyable because it takes so long to level? I think not. 100-200 hours would be a better story. I realize that things are better now, but frankly that was a strong point when I decided not to play wow before patch 2.3.

**On my favorite zones&#8230;
  
** 
  
Tanaris looks awesome&#8230; so do most of the blood elf zones. I really like Azshara too, unfortunately hardly any quests there. I think I like nagrand the best

**On Traveling&#8230;**

So much better in outland. seriously, Azeroth is a joke. While it&#8217;s cool for a bit, and instant travel everywhere would change the gameplay, it takes far to long to get anywhere in the old world. I&#8217;ve thought that the hearthstone should have a 30 min timer, and 2 possible zones &#8211; a main city and then a smaller city. Since level 40, I&#8217;ve always had my hearth set to a capital city. Why not have a secondary option as well?

**On Instances&#8230;**

Why didn&#8217;t I discover them earlier? These are hands down my favorite part of wow. It is the only place where there is any true sense of teamwork/cooperation. BG&#8217;s simply aren&#8217;t it, and for a simple reason: there is no shared accountability. If you cause a wipe during an instance, people are mad at you. If you leave early during an instance, you know people think you&#8217;re a jerk. So for the most part, people recognize this, and they get their act together and work as a TEAM, which is remarkable since ultimately there is not real-world accountability. Instances are always a challenge (in a good way), and provide for a good deal of gameplay tension. A hallmark of a good game is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and I&#8217;ve found that instances provide this again and again. Not to mention good loot and XP, what&#8217;s not to like? I&#8217;ve done one instance since hitting 70, and It was still a blast without any real personal gain.

**On Personal Life balance&#8230;**

I haven&#8217;t been playing computer games much since 2004&#8230; So wow was a bit of a renaissance for me&#8230; I am going to gradually tone down play to the point where I&#8217;m playing less hours per day. I have other interests I want to pursue as well that I haven&#8217;t been&#8230;

**On What&#8217;s next&#8230;**

Going to see. I&#8217;d like to get my full S1 PVP set, and there are some craftable items I&#8217;m looking forward to. I&#8217;m going to stay a tank until the rest of the guild is up to 70, then I will probably switch back to dps. Wouldn&#8217;t mind getting my foot in the door for some raids, but I wouldn&#8217;t pursue this until I have my &#8220;welfare&#8221; epics and get a sense of what life is like as a 70. the daily&#8217;s look promising, hopefully they don&#8217;t get boring. I&#8217;m actually hoping now that WoTLK doesn&#8217;t come out until late this year or next year&#8230;

Oh, and stay tuned for&#8230; Warbiking!
