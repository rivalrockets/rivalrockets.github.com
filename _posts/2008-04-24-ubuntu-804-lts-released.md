But never fear! BitTorrent works like a champ in times like these!

New features to get giddy about:

  * Xorg 7.3 &#8211; the desktop engine, with some changes that have emphasis on ease of resolution and dpi management
  * Gnome 2.22 &#8211; newest release of the Gnome desktop, very polished interface (tends to feel like OSX to me)
  * Added default applications: _Transmission_ for BitTorrent protocol, _Brasero_ for integrated CD/DVD burning
  * And more that I won&#8217;t bother to list

I currently use the Ubuntu OS to run my MythTV system and, you guessed it, this website.
