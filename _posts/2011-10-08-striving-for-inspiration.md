I feel like I need a project, something in which to get lost in the tiny details.

Software side projects appeal to me, but the initial pain of starting seems to be keeping me at bay. Oh, and the fact that I don't really have any ideas of what I'd like to build.

My software interests are more utility than outright new globally useful social etc. etc... one thing that "floats my boat" if you will is typesetting or markup to document generation. I like the idea that a system can let you simply edit a block of text and with no repeated thought, simply apply a process to the source and&nbsp;_viola!_ -- you have content. &nbsp;See [DocBook](http://www.docbook.org/), [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/)/[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to see some of the cool things that are out there... perhaps I should build something with one of those.
