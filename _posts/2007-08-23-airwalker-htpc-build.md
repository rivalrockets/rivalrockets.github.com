This is for size comparison, the old media PC is that grey server tower to the left, the new home of its parts in the foreground.<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="1" border="0" alt="1" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/1.jpg" width="604" height="445" />&#160;

Here is the old case opened up, this illustrates how this server case was pretty major overkill for my media setup, notice the excess of space around the motherboard and room for six hard drives. <img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2" border="0" alt="2" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2.jpg" width="604" height="451" />

Transplant compete and ready for testing.     <img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2b" border="0" alt="2b" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2b.jpg" width="604" height="451" />

New media PC case. The idea was to build it to fit into a standard entertainment rack&#8230; it fits, but barely.     <img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="3" border="0" alt="3" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/3.jpg" width="604" height="451" />

Here is a picture of the final setup. The rack will look better with the shelves filled<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="4" border="0" alt="4" src="http://rivalrockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/4.jpg" width="604" height="451" />
