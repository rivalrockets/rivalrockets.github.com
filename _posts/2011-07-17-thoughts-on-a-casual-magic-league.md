Now that I’ve been playing Magic the Gathering for about six months, I have a good understanding of what Magic is about.&#160;&#160; There are basically three venues where you can play magic:

  * Casually with Friends
  * Online with the World!
  * Organized play at “local” events, and occasionally larger regional gatherings i.e. FNM, Grand Prix’s etc.

This post is about the first way.&#160;&#160; I’ve tried the other two ways, which can be fun, but are $$$.&#160;&#160;&#160; My goal is to organize a weekly/bi-weekly event that is fun but doesn’t cost a lot of money.&#160;&#160; 

Magic is an immense game, but is broken up into various formats.&#160; The flavor of the game varies greatly with the type of format, and most are pretty fun:&#160;&#160; 

  * Constructed – 1:1 games / matches
  * Standard – only recent cards allowed
  * Pauper – only common cards allowed.&#160;&#160; 
  * Extended – allow cards from the past few years
  * Modern – allow cards from ~8th edition on, typically if it has the “modern” looking border/text
  * Vintage / Legacy – Because $1500 decks are cool, amirite?

  * Multiplayer 
  * Commander / EDH – 40 life, 100 card deck with no duplicates, legendary creature designated as the “general”.&#160;&#160; Basically @kydoon’s dream format
  * Free-for-All – Sit back and pretend like you have bad cards/hand, otherwise you will be dead in two turns.
  * Two headed Giant – 4 players, two on each time – shared 30 life total
  * Emperor – 6 players, 3 on each time, one person on each team is the “emperor”, and if dies the team loses

  * Limited
  * Booster Draft 4-10 players, each person has 3 packs.&#160; People sit around a table, open 1 pack, pick a card, then pass left or right.&#160; Everyone picks this way until all cards picked (you own what you pick, not what’s in the pack), then next pack is opened.&#160;&#160; Then, each players takes the 40+ cards they picked, and builds a 40 card deck with any number of basic lands (provided separate from the 3 packs).&#160;&#160;&#160; Then players play a 3-5 round tournament
  * Sealed Deck – each player opens 6 packs, and builds a 40 card deck, then starts a 3-5 round tournament.&#160;&#160;&#160; This is kind of fun with a new set, but it basically means that if you have a bad sealed pool you will be at a disadvantage.&#160; 

I’d like to see four different events each month from the previous list.&#160;&#160; The formats I would like to see:

## Week 1 – Booster Draft

This would require a minimum of 4 players, with the ideal number being 4,6, or 8 (odd numbers requires one person to sit out each round).&#160;&#160; The standard draft is about 20 minutes for picks, 10-20 for deck construction, than 40-50 minute match rounds (best 2/3).&#160;&#160; 

This format would require people to pay or bring their own packs, but here’s the thing – most people buy their boosters at $4.&#160; I can buy a box at SCG for about $100 shipped for 36 packs – that’s 2.75 a pack – so a draft (which is 3 packs a person) would only cost about 9-10, and still have a prize booster or two.&#160;&#160; That’s a pretty good deal considering most FNM drafts cost about $15.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

I’ve recently come to the conclusion that booster packs are basically a rip-off… but they are really fun if you draft them!&#160;&#160; In fact, many of the cards in an expansion are specifically designed for drafting.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

## Week 2 – Multiplayer / Commander

I really want to get into Commander, especially now that you can buy a complete deck for $30.&#160;&#160; The thing is, this format really wants 3 or more people, and 2-3 hours for a single game!&#160;&#160; 

## Week 3 – Constructed Tournament

Needs a minimum of four people, with even number of players ideal.&#160;&#160; We can do 3 match rounds, and if people want to throw in a $1-$2 we can throw in some boosters.&#160;&#160; I’d say that if do prizes we should stick to standard.&#160;&#160;&#160; 

## Week 4 – FFA Multiplayer / Whatever

Could be something like Emperor or two-headed giant, another commander night, etc.

&#160;

So here is what I would like to contribute to such an endeavor.&#160;&#160;&#160; Hosting 2 events a month at my house in OC.&#160;&#160; I’d probably do 4 if there was an interest, but it’s probably more convenient to do some events in O’Brien County… 

I’d also be willing to purchase booster boxes from SCG, and provide basic lands&#160;&#160; If anyone wants to straight buy cards this way that would be cool too. 

Also I think that Mon-Thu are the better times for scheduling – sometimes I might want to go to the FNM in Sioux City!&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I’m not suggesting that people to commit to every week, but if we can get 3-4 people a week somewhere playing magic it will be fun!&#160;&#160;
