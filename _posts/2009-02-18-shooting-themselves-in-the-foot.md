Earlier last year I discovered the music of My Chemical Romance through this youtube [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9rGlcBF4_A): 

 

I really liked the song but I didn't know what it was at first, eventually finding out it was "the ghost of you". After Kit exposed me to his MCR collection I quickly became a fan. Now after a year I come back to this video to find :

If this had been done a year ago I might never have heard of MCR...

It seems to me that the horse and buggy makers are trying to make it illegal to drive cars in the city limits...
