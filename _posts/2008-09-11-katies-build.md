One of the biggest reasons I've been neglecting my blog is the recent influx of computer building adventures

I present my sister's new gaming machine: _**Mystique**_

Processor: Intel E8500 @ 3.17 GHz
  
Video: EVGA 9800GTX+
  
RAM: Corsair XMS 2x1GB (CAS latency 4)
  
Storage: WD 640GB SATA

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Update:</span> Note that I initially used the stock heatsink, but we quickly decided to upgrade it to the tried and true [Arctic Cooling Freezer 7](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134) which, as always, brought peace of mind that the CPU was in good hands.

Ignore the dazed looking fool in this pic...

Bottom cage out to accommodate the gargantuan proportions of the 9800GTX+

Behind the door: two quick-access covers for the intake filters.

Note the required removal of the bottom hard drive cage. This actually worked out well for two reasons. First, the 9800GTX+ is massive, and wouldn't have fit with the cage installed; also, use of the additional front intake fan forces the "sacrifice" of a cage so it worked out quite well!

9800GTX wants all your PCI-E powers!

Final setup, wiring complete.
