When it comes to classic Disney _Animated_ films, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m a pretty big film guru. Whenever my family and I play Disney Trivial Pursuit, I&#8217;m a force to be reckoned with. Disney Channel _shows_, however&#8230;no. Simply no to a good majority. Although some, repeat, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> have potential, I scoff at most. A most profound example from the great throng I deem unacceptable, is this new series focusing on Peter Pan&#8217;s silent and rueful sidekick, Tinker Bell. I admit that I have not seen a single episode of _Fairies_, which takes a look at the scheming nymph in an entirely new light. However, from the ads I&#8217;ve been subjected to, I can plainly see that Tink is very talkative, happy, fun loving, and suddenly has a massive society of friends who share her species. They all live in a zone of Neverland called &#8220;Fairy Hollow&#8221; and primarily take up residence in a deformed tree.

(I&#8217;d like to acknowledge here that I consider J.M. Barrie&#8217;s novels of the early 20th century to be of separate, yet superior canonical origins.)

I notice in this series, that there seems to be no reference to Peter Pan at all, and conversely, the Disney adaptation of Peter Pan makes no mention of Tinker Bell&#8217;s fellow fairies. This leads me to believe that _Fairies_ is a prequel. It almost has to take place before Peter&#8217;s time. Then why, in Peter Pan, is there no mention of these other Fairies? I&#8217;ll tell you why, because those other fairies are dead. What happened?

Genocide?
  
Plague?
  
Years of political instability resulting in a collapse of their primitive autocratic society (There&#8217;s a queen fairy in the series), leading to civil war?

I&#8217;m theorizing genocide.

Think about it, let&#8217;s say that near the end of the _Fairies_ series, Captain Hook and his crew arrive in Neverland, and set up the cosmic island as a post for rum running, smuggling, and slave trade not legally sanctioned by British parliament. While the pirates are in conflict with the Natives, the Fairies also go to war against the outlaws. With the ability to grant anything the gift of flight, the Neverlanders take an advantage in the battle, yet this is not enough. Tinker Bell is sent to the human realm to get help. She manages to enlist the aid of a young delinquent from England named Peter Pan at the promise of eternal youth. Little to Tink&#8217;s knowledge, the Pirates see the Fairies more or less as insects that provide the Natives with too much of an edge, and prepare to deploy crude insecticide to wipe them out.

Peter and Tinker Bell arrive back in Neverland to find Fairy Hollow under siege. Tink attempts to save some of her friends, but only arrives in time to see them dying from the noxious pesticide. Peter saves her from inhaling too much of the gas, and helps Neverland fight Captain Hook back into the bay.

Peter decides that Neverland will need a standing militia in order to hold off the nefarious pirates, and with the help of Tink, gathers together the rag-tag band of the _Lost Boys_.

Tinker Bell, however, is traumatized to the point of never speaking again, except in twinkles and pings. She becomes very distrusting of outsiders that aren&#8217;t recruited by agreement of both her and Peter. She also owes a life debt to Peter after he saved her from the poison gas, and is very over protective of him. Then Peter recruits Wendy without Tink&#8217;s approval, and the movie begins.

Of course, this is only theoretical. <img title="Sweating a little..." src="http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/a/animesweat.gif" alt="^^;" width="19" height="19" />
  
But doesn&#8217;t it seem eerily fitting to the gap between the franchises?

&#8230;I thought so at least.
