> Mr. Costanza. Your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there&#8217;s a good chance you may, one day, walk again.

Sean, we&#8217;re all hoping for the best.Â  hang in there buddy!
