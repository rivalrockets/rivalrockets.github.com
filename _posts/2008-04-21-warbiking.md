About three years ago I had the idea to set up a workstation I could use while stationary cycling. I saw the need for more regular exercise, but I also wanted to reclaim the time somehow. The original idea was to do some programming work, but I found that it was very difficult to stay focused while exerting myself. I tried playing some old video games, and I actually managed to make it to the end of Dragon Warrior 1, as well as a bit of Final Fantasy 7 (I beat both games long ago). But I soon lost interest. It didn&#8217;t help that the bike I was extremely uncomfortable.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I had just started playing WOW, and this <span style="#ff9900;"><span style="underline;"><a href="http://theweightlifter.blogspot.com/2006/10/low-cal-6011-min-warbiking-3-months-41.html">article</a></span></span> caught my eye. I thought to myself, could a more comfortable biking position + a very addictive game work? I mulled it over for a while, then a few weeks ago I purchased an inexpensieve recumbant bike at Walmart. I really thought I would have to spend several hundred dollars to get a good bike, but this one only cost a hundred, and has a digital miles/speed/calories/time readout. It&#8217;s also solid and makes very little noise.

I think I&#8217;ve found what I need, so as of today I am beginning a 6 week plan to lose weight and get a lot of WOW stuff. I&#8217;m posting my plan here to help keep me accountable. I&#8217;ll be posting updates weekly, so stay tuned!

        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here&#8217;s the plan:</span></strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Cycle 2 hours per day, 5 days a week<br /> 5AM to 6AM, and then 5:15PM to 6:15PM</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>20 Miles per day<br /> 500 Calories per day<br /> 3 Lbs / week<br /> 50G per day<br /> 750 honor per day</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p style="left;">
        <strong>Over 6 weeks (30 days) this works out to:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>600 miles<br /> 15000 calories<br /> 18 lbs lost<br /> 1500G<br /> 22500 honor</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center;">

        Is this reasonable? I think so. Originally my goal was for 1K honor per hour, but thats simply not possible every time. If I win the daily and play 2-3 Alterac Valley&#8217;s, I can get over 1000, but that usually isn&#8217;t the case. Note that I&#8217;m not counting marks here. Physically my goal is a challenge, but reasonable. My current Body Fat % is around 26%. At 5&#8217;11&#8243; 200 lbs, my BMI is is 28, which is well above my normal range of 18.5-24.9. The trick to lowering that weight is burning enough calories to deplete my extra fat stores, and lowering my caloric intake. However I can&#8217;t starve myself either. If I fail to eat enough fats & protein, my body will literally begin to cannabilize itself. The minimum a healthy adult of my <span style="#ff9900;"><span style="underline;"><a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/">BMI</a></span></span> should eat is around 1200-1400 calories, with 1800 &#8211; 2200 being the norm. I&#8217;m going to shoot for 1400-1800, which I&#8217;ll adjust based on weight loss and hunger levels. The other quantity I can vary is the bike resistance, which will equal more calories per hour. I&#8217;ve done ten sessions so far, and I&#8217;ve worked up a good sweat by the end, but I haven&#8217;t been exhausted either.

        If all goes to plan I will drop down to 1 hour per day once I&#8217;ve reached my target weight of 180-185. Even for someone as obese as Kit <sic>, there are still several benefits to doing some type of aerobic exercise each day.
