A few months back I posted about wanting to try some board games, and getting a board game night together.&#160; A lot has happened since then, including the purchase of an Xbox 360 (a topic for another day), but I’m pleased to say I’ve finally got my hands on a board game I want to play.&#160; Enter DungeonQuest.

In DungeonQuest, the goal is to explore the dungeon/lair of a dragon in search of treasure, and get out with the loot before you get killed.&#160;&#160; The dungeon is different every time, so no two games can be alike.&#160;&#160; You can play solo or with four people total, in a quasi-co-op mode.&#160;&#160; Many of the traditional RPG elements are present, but the gameplay is different than what I’m used to.&#160;&#160; First, there is no GM.&#160; Players control any monsters that appear when they are not playing their own turn.&#160;&#160; Next, while dice are used for certain checks, encounters and combat are completely card-oriented.&#160; There are a \*lot\* of cards with this game, you definitely want to keep them organized.&#160; While you get to choose from six heroes with different powers, what a hero is able to do is largely determined by the shared combat deck.&#160;&#160;&#160; Yes, the wizard will cast spells, but is oddly quite handy with a battle-axe.&#160;

I decided to play my first game solo, to get an idea of the rules and play style.&#160;&#160; There is quite a bit of setup involved, and the learning curve is about medium, but I think it will be easy if you have someone showing you the ropes the first time you play.&#160;&#160; My first game took about two hours, but I was also poring over every single move and rule as I went along.&#160;&#160; Sadly I died without making it out, but these things happen in dragon lairs.&#160;&#160;

I think I can say that this is going to be a fun game for 2-4 players.&#160;&#160; Someone with a lot of time on their hands might enjoy the single player game, but frankly it seems like a lot of work.&#160;&#160; Most of the fun is going to see what befalls other players, and getting to fight them with monsters you happen to be running.&#160;&#160; Another real problem with single player is that there is precious little dungeon explored.&#160; I ended up getting stuck in a long dead-end, and wasn’t able to make it out before time ran out!.&#160;&#160; I imagine the board will be covered with tiles in multiplayer games so that wouldn’t be a problem then.&#160; 

So, all I need to do is set up a game night!&#160;&#160; I’ll probably send some stuff out on twitter in the next week or so.&#160;&#160;&#160; I’ll play a few two-player games by then (with my wife) to get an even better feel for the rules.&#160;
